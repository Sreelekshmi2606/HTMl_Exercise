                    <P> Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book written by Robert T. Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. 
It advocates the importance of financial literacy, financial independence and building 
wealth through investing in assets, real estate investing, starting and owning businesses, 
as well as increasing one's financial intelligence. </P>
                    <p> Rich Dad Poor Dad is written in the style of a set of parables, ostensibly based on Kiyosaki's 
ife.[1] The titular "rich dad" is his friend's father who accumulated wealth due to entrepreneurship 
and savvy investing, while the "poor dad" is claimed to be Kiyosaki's own father who he says worked hard
all his life but never obtained financial security. </p>
